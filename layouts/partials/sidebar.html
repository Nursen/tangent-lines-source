<span class="mdl-layout__title"> Hey There! </span>
My name is Nursen and this is my corner of the internet. Check out the tags for book reccommendations, cooking blogs I like, and letters to my past self. If you see something interesting, feel free to go off on a tangent, that's kind of what I do best. Enjoy!
